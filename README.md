### This repository contains an implementation of the QR Algorithm from scratch
- QR Algorithm stems from two key concepts: QR decomposition and matrix similarity transformations
- Well, the motivation behind the idea of expressing a matrix in the form QR is explained in detail [here](https://medium.com/puzzle-sphere/qr-through-lens-a5b3a9346795?sk=085b346b741ac8267e99aa3c962d4736)
- To understand why iterative QR decompositions converge to a matrix with eigenvalues along its diagonal, check [this article](https://applied-math-coding.medium.com/data-science-computation-of-eigenvectors-qr-algorithm-fff47ecbddc1)
- The key idea is that the matrices generated in each iteration are similar matrices, and therefore they share the same eigenvalues.
